Mermaiditor is a [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) diagram editor with local storage, and organization features.

The main features are:

- Projects, which are a collection of diagrams. Projects can be shared by exporting/importing as JSON.
- Diagrams, which are rendered using mermaid.

You can save files in browser's storage, or in local file ; but that only works with browsers based on Chromium for now (e.g. Chrome, Edge or Chromium).

It's available [here](https://cfe84.github.io/mermaiditor).
